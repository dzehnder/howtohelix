                            <p>Lizards are the largest groups in the reptile family, with over 6,000 members! They include all reptiles, apart from snakes!</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Some lizards can detach their tails if caught by surprise</li>
                                <li>Lizards live almost everywhere!</li>
                                <li>Some species of lizard will go their entire lives without drinking water</li>
                                <li>While most lizards are not dangerous to be around, there are a few exceptions to this rule</li>
                                <li>Lizards can change color at will</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>There is also massive variation in the lizard family, with members from as small as a few centimeters to a few meters long! Some are herbivores, some are omnivores, and some are exclusively carnivores â€“ but they are all equally interesting!</p>
